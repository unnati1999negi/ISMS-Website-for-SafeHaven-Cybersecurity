# SafeHaven Asset Management Policy

## 1. Overview

This Asset Management Policy defines the SafeHaven’s approach to managing and protecting assets. It provides guidelines for asset identification, classification, ownership, and tracking to ensure comprehensive management of resources.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish controls and procedures for the effective management of assets to protect them from risks and maintain organizational security and compliance with regulatory standards.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all assets owned, leased, or controlled by the organization, including:
- **Network Infrastructure**: Routers, switches, and firewalls.
- **Computing Devices**: Laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile devices.
- **Software Assets**: Licensed software, custom applications, and cloud services.
- **Data Assets**: Customer data, financial records, and intellectual property.

## 4. Asset Register

The asset register is an up-to-date record of all critical assets, detailing their classification, location, ownership, and maintenance status. The register must be regularly updated to reflect any changes.

### 4.1 Asset Classification

Assets are categorized to ensure appropriate levels of security. Common classifications include:
1. **Confidential**: Highly sensitive data or resources (e.g., customer records, financial systems).
2. **Internal Use Only**: Information or resources restricted to internal access.
3. **Public**: Non-sensitive information that can be shared externally.

### 4.2 Sample Asset Details

Below is a sample layout for the asset register:

| Asset ID | Description                | Classification | Location    | Owner      | Security Measures         |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 001      | Payroll Server             | Confidential   | Data Center | IT Dept.   | Access control, encryption|
| 002      | Customer Database          | Confidential   | Cloud       | IT Dept.   | Encryption, backup        |

## 5. Asset Management Process

### 5.1 Asset Identification

Each asset is assigned a unique identifier (Asset ID) and entered into the asset register. This identifier will track the asset throughout its lifecycle.

### 5.2 Asset Ownership

- **Asset Owners**: Each asset must have an assigned owner responsible for its security, usage, and compliance with policies.
- **Departmental Responsibility**: Asset owners from respective departments (IT, Finance, HR) manage the assigned assets.

### 5.3 Asset Classification

Assets are classified based on sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and impact on operations. Classifications guide how assets should be handled and protected.

### 5.4 Asset Inventory and Tracking

The asset register must be reviewed regularly, and updates made for new or decommissioned assets. Changes in asset status, location, or ownership must be recorded promptly.

## 6. Asset Protection Measures

- **Access Control**: Access to assets is limited to authorized personnel based on their roles.
- **Data Encryption**: Confidential data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Physical Security**: Physical access to critical assets is restricted through badge systems and secure storage.
- **Regular Audits**: Perform periodic audits to verify asset records and security measures.

## 7. Compliance with Standards

The organization complies with relevant regulatory standards, including ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and GDPR. Asset management processes align with these standards to ensure best practices for security and privacy.

## 8. Maintenance and Review

This Asset Management Policy and the asset register are reviewed annually or as necessary to ensure ongoing relevance and accuracy. Asset owners and the ISMS team coordinate to ensure the policy and asset records reflect the organization’s current assets and security needs.
